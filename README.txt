Notes

	* The data structure I used for integrating the graph is a LinkedList
		- I used a LinkedList for the cities and routes
		- I used a normal ArrayList for the attractions in which I used af or loop to find the city associated with the attraction

	* The alogrithm I used to find the shortest weighted path was Dijkstra's algorithm
		- the running time of the algorithm is O(E lg V) where E is the number of edges (routes) and V is the number of vertives (cities)
